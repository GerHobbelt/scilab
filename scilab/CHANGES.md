Compilation
-----------

* GNU autotools have been updated to :
   - automake (GNU automake) 1.16.5
   - autoconf (GNU Autoconf) 2.71
   
* All builds require a C++17 compiler. Toolboxes might also want to use this standard by specifying `-std=c++17` as a `CFLAGS` under Linux and macOS.

* Migration to Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 and IntelÂ® oneAPI HPC Toolkit 2022.3.

* macOS: Build environment has been migrated to conda and now relies on clang and libc++, hence (existing) toolboxes with binary gateways have to be (re)compiled using the same conda environment (see https://gitlab.com/scilab/scilab/-/wikis/Developers/setup-Scilab-repository-macOS)
